Working with Git was new to me. VSC provides many opportunities for project control. Allows you to follow the project step by step. If necessary - undo changes and many more.

#### 1. Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools

In this task I learned the basic Linux commands and learned information about HTTP protocol. Most of the command I learned when I worked with Git. Learn about the updated HTTP protocol HTTP/1.1. From its new mines there are parallels and permanent connections. They increase client server service speed. HTTP - a protocol that every web developer should know!=)))

### Front-End Basics

#### 3. Intro to HTML & CSS

In this task I reviewed the basic elements of HTML and CSS. I was familiar with the basic rules, but some became new to me. 
Learned how the ***box-sizing*** works. Learned how ***margin collapse*** happens. This knowledge will be useful when working with CSS-styles.
